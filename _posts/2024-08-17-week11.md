# Node Type Emphasis

This week, I focused on refining the node labels in the graph visualization. 
The primary change was to emphasize the node types by applying bold formatting, making it easier to distinguish between different types at a glance.

Here's the updated code:

```diff
    // Text for new nodes
    nodeEnter.append('text')
      .attr("dy", ".35em")
      .attr("font-family", "sans-serif")
      .attr("font-size", this.config.fontSize + "px")
      .attr("pointer-events", "none")
      .attr("fill", "#000")
      .attr("y", 24)
      .attr("x", 10)
      .attr("text-anchor", "middle")
      .each(function(d: VisibleTrialNode) {
        const textLabel = d3_select(this);
        const name = d.data.name.split('<br>');
        if (name.length > 1) {
          textLabel.append("tspan")
            .attr("x", "10")
            .attr("dy", ".35em")
+           .attr("font-weight", "bold")
            .text(name[0]);
          textLabel.append("tspan")
            .attr("x", "10")
            .attr("dy", "1em")
            .text(name[1]);
          textLabel.attr("class", "nowrap")
        } else {
          return textLabel.text(d.data.name);
        }
      });

```

With this change, the node labels are more visually distinct:

# Work Submission

As GSoC 2024 approaches its conclusion, I am preparing for the work submission phase. 
My plan includes submitting a comprehensive pull request (PR) that encompasses all the work done throughout the project. 
This PR will be accompanied by detailed documentation, including an overview of the project and the implemented features.

The work submission will adhere to the guidelines provided by Googleâ€™s [GSoC documentation](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/work-product),
ensuring that all aspects of the project are well-documented and presented clearly. 
The PR will also include a link to the final report, summarizing the progress made over the course of the program.

This week has been crucial in fine-tuning the project and ensuring that it is ready for submission. 
I am excited to finalize the work and share the results with the community.
