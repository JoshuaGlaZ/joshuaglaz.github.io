# Graph Structure

After completing the initial graph, I encountered issues with the structure of the root and how child nodes reference their parent nodes. 
The main problem was that child nodes were `hardcoded` to reference the last inserted node, 
which caused problems in building accurate parent-child relationships. 
This approach was initially based on the logic used in tree graphs for activations.

To address this issue, I found a solution that avoids relying on the last inserted node. 
Instead of iterating through nodes in a preorder traversal and checking if the last node IDs (whole and part) 
match the relationship of available compositions, I changed the logic to directly check each node against its relationships.

For each relationship, the new logic checks if the current node matches the part_id in the relationship. 
If they match, it finds the parent node (`whole_id`) in the existing nodes and inserts the current node as a child of this parent. 
This approach is similar with `TrialAST` implementation of root building and ensures that
nodes are accurately linked based on their true parent-child relationships.

## define_node

Below is the refined `define_node` method that implements this new logic:

```python
def define_node(self, preorder, compositions):
        relationship = compositions
        for node in preorder:
            if node.type == 'script':
                root = self.insert_node(node, None)
                continue
            elif node.type != 'syntax':
                 for relation in relationship:
                    if node.id == relation.part_id:
                            find = next((n for n in self.nodes if n.node_id == relation.whole_id), None)
                            self.insert_node(node, find)
                            relationship.remove(relation)
                            break
        return root
```
The refined define_node method simplified the node insertion process by focusing on direct parent-child relationships
defined in the compositions. It ensures nodes are correctly linked based on their types and relationships
This method effectively manages node insertion by directly referencing parent nodes (`whole_id`) and their child nodes (`part_id`), 
making the graph construction more efficient and easier to follow.

## label revise

My mentor mentioned that the labels should not be the name of the node (`CodeComponent`). 
There are specific node that should be only the type of node, the combine name and type, and even the more specific node like `Attribute` 
that needed futher text processing. 

```python
def insert_node(self, node_, parent):
    """Create node"""
    node = Node(
        index=self.index,
        name=node_.type + " | " + node_.name,
        parent_index=-1,
        children_index=-1,
        children=[],
        node_id=node_.id,
        activations=defaultdict(list),
        duration=defaultdict(int),
        full_tooltip=True,
        tooltip=defaultdict(str),
        trial_ids=[],
        has_return=False,
    )

    if node_.type in {'global', 'nonlocal', 'assert', 'raise', 'await', 'yield', 'yield_from'}:
        node.name = node_.name
    elif node_.type == 'return':
        node.name = node_.type
    elif node_.type == 'attribute':
        node.name = node_.name.split('.')[1]
    ...
```

A Node object is initialized with various attributes. The label by default is initialized by `name | type`
Depending on the type of the node, the name attribute of the node which reponsible for the label of the node is adjusted accordingly:

- For types like `global`, `nonlocal`, `assert`, `raise`, `await`, `yield`, and `yield_from`, the node's name remains as node_.name.
- For `return` type nodes, the name is set to node_.type.
- For `attribute` type nodes, the name is derived from splitting node_.name and taking the second part. The reason being is because the node's name is formatted `name.attr`

Here is the corrected graph structure:

# Diff Graph

To finish the assignment of the definition graph with the help of my mentor, I created a Diff feature for the definition graph.
This feature visualizes the differences between the definitions, highlighting how they differ or align.

This graph is used to visualized the difference of definitions of two trials. It contain the same structure but has
the combined two roots of the two trials. It also has the necessary property for the info needed for the graph, similar to the definition graph

![Definition Diff Info](../assets/img/definition_diff_info.png "Definition Diff Info")

Then, I implemented the `DefinitionDiffGraph` class, which extends the `Graph` class to handle the specific needs of showing diffs.:

```

It has the mostly same code for the `DiffGraph`, only for the how to capture the tree cache is modified.
Instead of using the trial graph, it used the definition graph instead. 
The `create_diff` function combines two trial graphs by mapping nodes and merging edges. 
It creates a new graph structure that integrates nodes and edges from both trials, allowing for a side-by-side comparison.


Finally, I added a new route that serves the difference graph between two trial definitions as a JSON response. 
This allows users to request and visualize the differences directly through the API.

```python
...
from ..models.definition_diff import DefinitionDiff
...

...
@app.route("/experiments/<expCode>/diff/<trial1>/<trial2>/<graph_mode>-<cache>.json")
@app.route("/definition/diff/<trial1>/<trial2>/<graph_mode>-<cache>.json")
def definition_diff_graph(trial1, trial2, graph_mode, cache,expCode=None):
    """Respond definition diff graph as JSON"""
    diff_object = DefinitionDiff(trial1, trial2)
    graph = diff_object.graph
    graph.use_cache &= bool(int(cache))

    _, diff_result, _ = getattr(graph, graph_mode)()
    return jsonify(**diff_result)
...
```

This is the example of the definition diff graph:

![Definition Diff Graph 1](../assets/img/definition_diff1_graph.svg.svg "Definition Diff Graph 1")
![Definition Diff Graph 2](../assets/img/definition_diff2_graph.svg.svg "Definition Diff Graph 2")

The colors in the graph indicate the existence of nodes and edges in the trials:
- Red Border: The node exists only in the first trial.
- Green Border: The node exists only in the second trial.
- Black Vertical Line: The node exists in both trials.

Edges follow the same color scheme, indicating their presence in either or both trials.

For week 10, I'll focused to implement the interface of the noWorkFlow new feature `DefinitionGraph`, `DefinitionDiffGraph`, and `TrialAST`.
