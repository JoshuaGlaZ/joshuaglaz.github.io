DroveVSBird is a machine learning project that classifies images of drones and birds using advanced image processing and SVM models.

###### Key Features
- **Image classification**: Distinguishes between drones and birds in images.
- **Data augmentation**: Improves model robustness with augmented datasets.
- **HOG preprocessing**: Uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients for feature extraction.
- **Multiple classifiers**: Evaluates and compares different machine learning models.

###### Usage
See the [drone-vs-bird repository](https://github.com/JoshuaGlaZ/drone-vs-bird) for code, datasets, and instructions.
