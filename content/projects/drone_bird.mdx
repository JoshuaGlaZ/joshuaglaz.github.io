DroneVSBird is a machine learning web application that distinguishes between drones and birds in images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. The project includes both a Flask backend API and a PHP frontend web interface, achieving 98.7% accuracy on the test set after hyperparameter tuning.

- **Image Classification**: Upload images through a web interface for instant drone/bird classification
- **High Accuracy Model**: Achieved 98.7% accuracy using SVM with HOG feature extraction
- **Data Augmentation**: Improved model robustness with augmented training datasets
- **Multiple Classifiers**: Evaluated and compared different machine learning models
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose for both frontend and backend

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), PHP
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Docker, Git
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run DroneVSBird is using Docker, which sets up both the Flask backend and PHP frontend automatically:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaGlaZ/drone-vs-bird.git
cd drone-vs-bird
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the application:
- **Flask Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **PHP Frontend Web Interface**: http://localhost:8085

### Option 2: Local Development

#### Backend Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaGlaZ/drone-vs-bird.git
cd drone-vs-bird
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Using PHP's built-in server
php -S localhost:8085
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8085
2. Click "Choose File" and select an image of a drone or bird
3. The system will process the image and display the result (Drone or Bird)
