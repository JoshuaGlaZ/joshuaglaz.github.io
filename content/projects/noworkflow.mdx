noworkflow is an open-source tool for Python that automatically traces and visualizes Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) from scripts. It helps users analyze, compare, and understand code transformations during development or experimentationâ€”without modifying the original script.

- **Automatic AST tracing**: Capture ASTs from Python scripts with no code changes.
- **Visualization**: Visualize and compare ASTs to understand code evolution.
- **Open source**: Community-driven and extensible.
- **No code modification required**: Works transparently with your existing scripts.

## Installation

Ready to get started? Here are the concise instructions for installing noworkflow. For comprehensive details and troubleshooting, please refer to the [official noworkflow GitHub repository](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow).

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

For a quick setup, use pip. This method installs the stable version along with common dependencies for provenance analysis:

```bash
pip install noworkflow[all]
```

If you only need the core noWorkflow functionality without the provenance analysis tools, you can install just the essential components:

```bash
pip install noworkflow
```
### Installing the Latest Version (from Source)

To get the most up-to-date stable version, clone the repository and install from source. This is recommended for accessing the newest features and compatibility with recent Python versions (e.g., Python 3.12.4).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gems-uff/noworkflow.git
cd noworkflow
python setup.py install
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## Usage

noWorkflow operates transparently, requiring no modifications to your Python scripts. Here's a brief overview of common commands. For a complete guide and advanced features, check out the [official documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow).

### Basic Execution & Provenance

To run a Python script with noWorkflow and automatically capture its provenance:
```bash
now run script.py
```
Use the -v (verbose) option for detailed feedback during execution:
```bash
now run -v script.py
```
Each run generates a unique "trial" stored in the provenance database.
### Managing Trials

- List all trials:
```bash
now list
```
This command shows a summary of all recorded trials, including their status (f for not finished, * for finished, b for backup).

- Restore files from a trial:
```bash
now restore [trial_id]
```
Restores the script, imported local modules, and initial file accesses from a specific trial. Use options like -s (skip script), -l (skip modules), or -a (skip file accesses). You can also restore a single file using now restore -f path.

- View trial details:
```bash
now show [trial_id]
```
Displays detailed information about a trial. Options include -m (module dependencies), -d (function definitions), -e (environment context), -a (function activations), -p (noworkflow parameters), and -f (file accesses).

- Compare two trials:
```bash
now diff [trial1_id] [trial2_id]
```
Compares the provenance data of two trials. Options exist to compare modules (-m), environment (-e), or file accesses (-f).

### Advanced Analysis & Export

- Generate dataflow graph (Graphviz DOT format):

```bash
now dataflow [trial_id] -m prospective | dot -Tpng -o prospective.png
```
- Export provenance to Prolog facts:

```bash
now export [trial_id]
```
- Export provenance to PROV-O format:

```bash
prov [trial_id]
```
- View database schema (SQL or Prolog):

```bash
now schema sql
now schema prolog
```

- Check history evolution graph:

```bash
now history [trial_id]
```

- Query evaluations and dependencies:

```bash
now evaluation      # Shows executions and accesses to values
now evaluation wdf  # Identifies dataflow dependency relationships
```

- Export AST (Prolog or Notebook):

```bash
now ast [trial_id]
```

You can also specify output format using -j (--json) for JSON or -d (--dot) for Graphviz dot format:

```bash
now ast [trial_id] --dot
```
