noworkflow is an open-source tool for Python that automatically traces and visualizes Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) from scripts. It helps users analyze, compare, and understand code transformations during development or experimentationâ€”without modifying the original script.

- **Automatic AST tracing**: Capture ASTs from Python scripts with no code changes.
- **Visualization**: Visualize and compare ASTs to understand code evolution.
- **Open source**: Community-driven and extensible.
- **No code modification required**: Works transparently with your existing scripts.
