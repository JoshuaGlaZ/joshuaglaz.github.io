AIRA is an AI‑powered piano mentor built by Team C242‑PS540 for the Bangkit Academy 2024 Capstone. A real-time piano learning assistant that detects note and rhythm errors in under 300 ms, providing instant feedback to students via an Android client. Built with a Flask backend for low-latency audio processing and machine learning classification.

- **Real‑Time Feedback**: Classifies Wrong Note, Missing Note, Extra Note, or No Error against reference MIDI with ~92% accuracy.
- **Low-Latency Feedback** – End-to-end processing time under 300 ms.
- **Cross-Platform Streaming** – Streams audio from Android app to Python backend.
- **ML-Driven Classification** – Trained on annotated piano audio datasets for robust detection.
- **Immediate Learning Aid** – Students can self-correct mistakes mid-practice session.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **ML Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Librosa
- **Client**: Android (Java/Kotlin)
- **Other Tools**: NumPy, Pandas, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
